# ðŸ“Œ Architecture Diagrams

This folder contains all the **network and security architecture** diagrams for the Kali Linux Attack & Defense Lab.

## ** Network Topology Diagram (`network-topology.png`)**
**What It Shows:**  
- The entire **lab setup**, including:
  - Kali Linux (Attacker)
  - Victim Machines (Windows/Linux)
  - Security Monitoring Tools (SIEM, IDS, Firewalls)
  - Network segmentation & IP ranges

**Purpose:**  
- Helps visualize how the attack simulation environment is structured.
- Shows how network traffic flows between attacker and victim machines.

---

## ** Attack Flow Diagram (`attack-flow.png`)**
**What It Shows:**  
- The **step-by-step process of an attack**, from reconnaissance to exploitation.
- Attack techniques used (Nmap scanning, Metasploit exploits, privilege escalation).
- Lateral movement techniques.

**Purpose:**  
- Helps understand **how attackers progress through different attack phases**.
- Maps to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** for real-world attack simulation.

## ** Defense Strategy Diagram (`defense-strategy.png`)**
ðŸ“Œ **What It Shows:**  
- Key **security controls** to detect, prevent, and mitigate attacks.
- Defensive tools used (SIEM, IDS, Firewalls).
- Hardening techniques for target machines.

âœ… **Purpose:**  
- Helps define **a security blueprint** for protecting against cyberattacks.
- Shows **how incident response teams should react** to detected threats.
