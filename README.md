# Kali Linux Attack Defense Framework
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full attack & defense simulation using only Kali Linux tools. It helps cybersecurity professionals understand both offensive and defensive security in real-world scenarios.
# Objectives
1. Simulate real-world cyberattacks using Kali Linux.
2. Document step-by-step attack techniques with screenshots.
3. Implement detection and defense strategies.
4. Provide a security blueprint for mitigating cyber threats.
# Tools Used (All Pre-Installed in Kali Linux)
1. Reconnaissance: Nmap, Harvester, WhatWeb
2. Exploitation: Metasploit, Hydra, Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)
3. Privilege Escalation: LinPEAS, WinPEAS, Kernel Exploits
4. Persistence & Lateral Movement: Evil-WinRM, pth-winexe
5. Data Exfiltration: Netcat, Steghide
6. Defense Mechanisms: Wireshark, Suricata, Fail2Ban
# Attack Scenarios
Each attack scenario includes:
1. Step-by-step commands
2. Screenshots
3. Expected results
4. How to detect and mitigate it
# Defense Strategies
1. Intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS)
2. Firewall configurations
3. Endpoint security best practices
4. Incident response playbooks
# Demo
A recorded video demonstrating the attacks and defenses in action.
